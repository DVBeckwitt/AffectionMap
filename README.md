# AffectionMap

A Python tool for visualizing and comparing love language profiles between individuals. Generates radar plots to show alignment
between how people give and receive love, with correlation metrics to quantify compatibility.

## Getting started

1. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended).
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Launch the graphical interface:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. Enter the names and love language scores (0â€“10) for each person and click **Generate Compatibility Report** to view the radar charts and insights.

The application requires a desktop environment capable of displaying Tkinter windows.
